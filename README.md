# kozzeluc.github.io

This repository hosts all of my public Eclipse update sites:

- dmlj: Eclipse CA IDMS™/DB Schema Diagram Editor update sites:

  - latest:   the one that is configured on the Eclipse Marketplace: https://kozzeluc.github.io/dmlj/latest
    (cfr the master branch of the dmlj repo: https://github.com/kozzeluc/dmlj/tree/master)

  - snapshot: the one that contains fixes that are not yet included in the latest update site: https://kozzeluc.github.io/dmlj/snapshot
    (cfr the develop branch of the dmlj repo: https://github.com/kozzeluc/dmlj/tree/develop)

  - archive:  archived versions of update sites that were published as the latest version. It is never a bad idea to download the lastest 
    archived version for the case that I can no longer host the update sites on a public space.
  
  Note that the Eclipse CA IDMS™/DB Schema Diagram Editor update sites were hosted elsewhere before but because of sunsetting issues I have
  put them here on GitHub; only the archived version published early 2022 (v3.4.3.202202131226) was included in the archive folder when this
  repository was created in the summer of 2023.
